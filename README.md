# Proactive Forensics for Online Exam Using Log Management Approach

This repository contains the complete thesis and related resources for **"Proactive Forensics for Online Exam Using Log Management Approach"** submitted to the School of Computing, Telkom University, as part of the requirements for the degree of Master of Forensic Science.

## 📄 Abstract

The rapid adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMS) in Indonesia has brought significant opportunities and challenges, especially regarding the integrity and security of online examinations. This thesis proposes a proactive forensic framework for online exam environments, leveraging structured log management based on NIST SP 800-92 standards and integrating machine learning-based anomaly detection. The proposed system enables automated log collection, centralized storage, real-time analysis, and timely alerting, significantly enhancing forensic readiness and the ability to detect and respond to academic misconduct in digital exams.
