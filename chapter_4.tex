	\caption{Digital Forensic Evidence Loss \cite{larchenko2025mindmap}}
	\label{fig:df-evidence-loss}
\end{figure}

One of the major risks in digital forensic investigations is the loss of critical evidence due to various technical and procedural factors. These losses can compromise the integrity, completeness, and legal admissibility of evidence, thereby weakening the overall investigation. Evidence loss may occur during collection, transmission, storage, or analysis phases—often unnoticed until a post-incident review. Therefore, proactive mechanisms must be in place to preserve, validate, and monitor digital logs systematically.

Phase 1 of the proposed framework focuses on defining the core objectives and technical requirements, as introduced in Chapter 3. This phase emphasizes the proactive nature of digital forensic readiness, where logs are collected, preserved, and structured long before any examination session or security incident occurs.


This phase ensures that the framework's direction remains aligned with long-term forensic preparedness, enabling timely evidence collection and minimizing the risk of missing critical data when incidents do occur.

	\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{9cm}|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Challenge} & \textbf{Description} \\
		\hline
		Many Log Sources & Log data is generated by numerous systems and devices (e.g., applications, servers, network devices, security tools), making it difficult to collect, aggregate, and manage logs centrally. Coordinating log collection across heterogeneous environments is a major challenge. \\
		\hline
		Inconsistent Log Content & Different log sources may record different types of events, levels of detail, or use varying field names, leading to gaps or redundancies in the data. This inconsistency complicates log analysis, correlation, and incident detection. \\

		Inconsistent Timestamps & Log sources may use different time zones, formats, or unsynchronized system clocks. This causes issues in event sequencing, correlation, and forensic reconstruction of incident timelines. \\
		\hline
		Inconsistent Log Format & Logs may be structured (e.g., JSON, XML) or unstructured (plain text), with diverse field arrangements and delimiters. Parsing and normalizing logs from various formats into a unified schema is complex and error-prone. \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:log_management_challenges}
\end{table}
As summarized in Table~\ref{tab:log_management_challenges}, organizations face several key challenges in effective log management. The presence of numerous log sources across heterogeneous systems complicates centralized collection and aggregation. Additionally, inconsistent log content and log formats hinder the standardization and normalization necessary for comprehensive analysis. Variations in timestamp formats and time synchronization issues further impede accurate event correlation and forensic investigation. Addressing these challenges is critical for establishing reliable, scalable, and forensically sound log management processes~\citet{kentnist800922006guide}.


\subsection{1.2 Research Objectives}
The main objective is to build a centralized and automated log management system that enables continuous monitoring and log acquisition in an online learning environment. The system should not wait for anomalies or incidents to occur, but instead establish an audit trail that is always active and available for future analysis.

Key system requirements identified in this phase include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Continuous log acquisition from key components such as Moodle, the operating system, database services, and web servers.
	\item A proactive scheduling mechanism (e.g., \texttt{crontab}) to retrieve logs at defined intervals, regardless of exam schedules.
	\item Centralized log storage with access control, timestamping, and integrity verification using cryptographic hashes.
	\item Compatibility with scalable infrastructure (e.g., Azure VMSS) to support dynamic resource allocation.
	\item Capability to export logs in a structured format (CSV/JSON) for downstream forensic processes.
	\item Readiness for future integration with machine learning-based analysis.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{1.3 Research Method}
To achieve the objectives outlined in the previous section, a structured method was designed based on a system development approach, incorporating best practices from digital forensic readiness and proactive log management frameworks. The methodology integrates technical implementation, experimental testing, and expert validation to ensure both functional performance and forensic reliability.

The core steps of the method are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Framework Design:} A modular architecture is designed, comprising components such as a log collector, scheduler, centralized log storage, machine learning engine, dashboard interface, and notification system. The design adheres to log lifecycle principles based on NIST SP 800-92.
	\item \textbf{Data Flow Implementation:} A data pipeline is developed to enable automated log acquisition, transmission using \texttt{rsync}, and storage into structured directories. The logs include user quiz attempts, question interaction steps, and system events from the Moodle platform.
	\item \textbf{Machine Learning Integration:} An unsupervised anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest) is trained using historical exam data to classify suspicious activity based on exam duration and scoring patterns.
	\item \textbf{Preservation and Reporting:} Log integrity is ensured through MD5 hashing and timestamping. Reports are generated in PDF format to assist investigators and administrators in analyzing flagged incidents.
	\item \textbf{Validation and Testing:} The system is tested in a simulated environment using real log data from an online English Proficiency Test (EPT), and the results are validated through expert review by digital forensic practitioners.
\end{itemize}

This method ensures that the framework is not only technically viable but also compliant with forensic principles of evidence preservation, integrity, and traceability. The combination of automation, machine learning, and structured log management offers a holistic solution for supporting proactive digital forensics in online examination systems.

\section{Phase 2}
Phase 2 focuses on conducting a comprehensive literature review to identify best practices, frameworks, and standards relevant to digital forensics in online education environments. This stage is critical for ensuring that the proposed framework is grounded in established knowledge and is capable of addressing current gaps in proactive forensic readiness.

The literature review emphasizes two main areas: (1) digital forensic frameworks, and (2) log management standards. Particular attention is given to the NIST Special Publication 800-92, which provides detailed guidelines for computer security log management. This standard outlines principles for log generation, collection, transmission, storage, analysis, and disposal, and serves as the core reference model for the framework in this study.

In addition, previous research by Adel et al \cite{adel2024ethicore}. and Alharbi et al\cite{proactiveandreactivedigitalforensics}. was reviewed to understand approaches in proactive and reactive forensics, particularly in e-learning and cloud-based environments. These studies highlighted the importance of early evidence acquisition, modular framework design, and integration with real-world systems such as LMS and cloud platforms.

Key insights extracted from this phase include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The necessity of proactive log acquisition to minimize evidence loss.
	\item Integration of log lifecycle processes with operational systems.
	\item Modular design that allows future expansion into anomaly detection and incident response.
	\item Challenges in standardizing log formats across heterogeneous sources.
\end{itemize}

This literature review provided both theoretical and practical direction for designing a customized framework suitable for scalable, secure, and evidence-ready examination systems. It also helped define the scope and limitations to be addressed in the design phase that follows.

\section{Phase 3}
\subsection{3.1 Define Architecture}
The definition of the framework architecture in this research is fundamentally based on established principles of log management, particularly those outlined in NIST SP 800-92. Log management is a systematic process encompassing the generation, collection, transmission, storage, analysis, monitoring, and preservation of log data.

Starting from this foundation, the architectural design for the proactive forensic framework was constructed to ensure that each critical phase of the log management lifecycle is represented and integrated as a modular component. The design began with the identification of log generation as the entry point, where all relevant events from the online exam environment are recorded.

Next, the architecture incorporates log storage and log analysis modules, which are responsible for securely preserving all collected logs and enabling their systematic examination to identify suspicious activities or anomalies.

Finally, the log monitoring component was positioned as the endpoint in the architecture, providing real-time visibility into system activities and immediate notification of potential incidents. This modular structure not only follows the best practices of log management but also ensures that digital evidence is handled in a way that supports forensic readiness, scalability, and traceability.

By aligning the architecture with the standard log management lifecycle, the framework can comprehensively address the requirements for evidence integrity, timely detection, and effective response within online examination systems.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figure/subphase-3.1-define-architecture.png}
	\caption{Define Log Management Infrastructure}
	\label{fig:lm-infrastructure}
\end{figure}
The initial architectural design of the proactive forensic log management framework was developed by mapping essential modules required for effective forensic readiness in an online examination environment. 

\subsection{3.2 Tools and Technique}

The implementation of the framework utilized a combination of open-source and proven technologies to ensure flexibility, security, and efficiency. Moodle LMS served as the core platform for online exams, deployed on Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) to support scalability. Log collection was automated using Linux \texttt{cron} jobs, while \texttt{rsync} over SSH was employed for secure log transmission. Centralized log storage was managed on a Linux server, with integrity verification via MD5 and SHA-256 hash algorithms. The log analyzer and machine learning anomaly detection module (Isolation Forest) were built using Python and scikit-learn, exposed as RESTful endpoints through Flask. For real-time alerts, the Telegram Bot API was integrated. Reporting was handled through custom scripts exporting activity and evidence data to standardized PDF format.

\subsection{3.3 Build-Evaluate Iteration}

The design and development process followed an iterative build-evaluate cycle, guided by continuous testing and expert feedback. The initial prototype implemented basic modules: log identification, automated collection, storage, and dashboard-based log analysis. Early evaluations revealed limitations, such as incompatibility with certain log formats and manual notification dependency. In subsequent iterations, key enhancements were made:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modular log parsers for heterogeneous sources (e.g., Moodle, Cloudflare, system logs).
	\item Automated notification system using Telegram Bot API.
	\item Extension of log retention from 3 to 90 days based on expert input.
	\item Integration of dual-hash (MD5/SHA-256) log preservation.
	\item Implementation of machine learning-based anomaly detection and audit trail features.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[ht]

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:build_eval}
\end{table}

\subsection{3.4 Evidence Source}

A systematic mapping of potential evidence sources was carried out to focus the framework on logs that are most relevant for forensic investigation of online examinations. The prioritized sources included:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Moodle Quiz Attempt Logs}: Detailed records of each student's exam session, time stamps, scores, and attempt patterns (\texttt{mdl\_quiz\_attempts}).
	\item \textbf{User Activity Logs}: Login/logout events, role assignments, and actions (\texttt{mdl\_user}, \texttt{mdl\_logstore\_standard\_log}).
	\item \textbf{Database Logs}: Error, warning, and transaction history supporting contextual analysis.
	\item \textbf{Cloudflare Security Logs}: HTTP events and threat detection at the application layer.
	\item \textbf{System and Web Server Logs}: OS-level and web server activity relevant to exam session environment.
\end{itemize}
Only evidence-rich and exam-related logs were selected for collection and analysis, reducing noise and focusing resources on data with high forensic value.

\subsection{3.5 Integrate Adaptability and Modularity}

To ensure sustainability and ease of future upgrades, the framework was developed with adaptability and modularity as core principles. Each module (collection, storage, analysis, preservation, notification) was designed as an independent service with standardized APIs and clear interfaces. This allowed for straightforward replacement or integration with other LMS platforms, logging tools, or machine learning engines. Modularity also enabled parallel development, testing, and scaling of individual components according to institutional requirements.

\subsection{3.6 Validate the Structure}

The completed framework structure and inter-component interactions were validated through a combination of expert interviews, simulation-based scenario testing, and peer review. Digital forensic and IT security specialists were consulted to assess the adequacy of the architecture, effectiveness of evidence sourcing, scalability, and forensic robustness. Feedback from validation exercises resulted in final refinements, including the strengthening of audit trails, optimization of automated alerting, and fine-tuning of anomaly detection thresholds. The validation confirmed that the framework is well-aligned with digital forensic best practices and adaptable to future technological and organizational changes.


\section{Phase 4}
\subsection{4.1 Setup Simulation Environment}
To evaluate the forensic log management framework under controlled and reproducible conditions, a dedicated simulation environment was established using local computing resources. This approach was chosen to avoid the complexity and cost of public cloud or distributed architectures, and to provide greater flexibility for configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting the testbed during experimentation.

The local network was isolated from production systems, ensuring that all testing activities remained contained and risk-free. This configuration allowed for the simulation of realistic online examination workflows, log generation, and incident scenarios without external dependencies or cloud-specific constraints. The environment could be easily reset or reconfigured between experiments, supporting multiple rounds of framework testing, validation, and refinement.

Log identification is done by identifying the sources that generate logs by reviewing the results from exam participants. The log attempt results will be stored in a database, therefore the log source is located in the MySQL database.
In the process of log analysis related to online examinations in Moodle, several database tables have been identified as essential sources of information for understanding user behavior and quiz performance. These tables are involved in recording quiz attempts and linking them to user profiles, course structures, and module instances.

The key identified tables include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{mdl\_quiz\_attempts}: This table stores individual quiz attempt records by users. It contains timestamps for when an attempt started and finished, along with the score achieved and the state of the attempt (e.g., in progress, finished).
	
	\item \textbf{mdl\_user}: This table contains user-specific information such as user ID, first name, last name, and authentication details. It allows quiz attempts to be linked directly to the participants.
	
	\item \textbf{mdl\_quiz}: This table stores metadata about each quiz, including its name, settings, grading method, and association to a course.
	
	\item \textbf{mdl\_course}: This table defines course-level information. It helps in organizing and grouping quizzes under the appropriate academic or training program context.
	
	\item \textbf{mdl\_course\_modules}: This table links quizzes to specific module instances within a course, enabling fine-grained selection of quiz activity based on module ID. It is critical for identifying which quizzes are deployed in which course sections.
\end{itemize}

Together, these tables provide a comprehensive relational schema for extracting, preprocessing, and analyzing quiz attempt data in a structured and meaningful way.

\subsubsection{4.2.2 Proactive Collection}
In modern system administration, the use of \textbf{cron job} on Linux/Unix systems is a prevalent method for performing automated, periodic tasks such as log extraction, data transformation, or backup. Cron enables precise scheduling through the \texttt{crontab} utility, which defines job frequency using five time fields: minute, hour, day, month, and weekday \citet{davidovic2015cron}.

Academic validation of this method is found in related research. For instance, Hazwam et al. propose a cron-triggered Perl script to periodically parse honeypot logs into a database, significantly reducing storage requirements and improving system performance \citet{halim2019honeypot}. This demonstrates the effectiveness of cron-based scheduling for resource-efficient log handling.

Furthermore, system reliability and auditing are supported by best practices from NIST SP 800‑92, which emphasize the scheduling of log management routines for integrity checks and retention.

In summary, \textbf{cron-based periodic log collection}  offers a lightweight, scalable, and verifiable method for preserving and processing database-derived logs, and is validated both in the field and in academic literature.

Proactive collection for automated collection. automated collection systematic for collecting and storing data or evidence before incidents occur that could lead to data loss. There are three types of logs that will be collected: attempt logs, quiz attempt step logs, and course activity logs.

Figure~\ref{fig:scheduler} shows the job scheduler used for periodic log collection. It automates the retrieval of log data from the database and system components, ensuring timely collection and synchronization to centralized storage to support proactive forensic.To extract detailed quiz attempt logs for further analysis, a structured SQL query was designed to retrieve records from multiple interconnected tables within the Moodle database schema. The focus of this query is to obtain finished quiz attempts from specific course modules associated with the quiz activity.

To facilitate log analysis related to online examinations within the Moodle platform, a specific SQL query was constructed to extract quiz attempt data based on the associated course identifier (course id). This approach ensures that only relevant records tied to a particular course and quiz activity are processed, improving both performance and precision in downstream analytics.
\subsubsection{4.2.3 Log Transmission}
To support secure and efficient log transmission, the system utilizes the \texttt{rsync} protocol to transfer collected log files from the master virtual machine (VM), which hosts the examination platform, to a centralized log storage server. The use of \texttt{rsync} enables incremental synchronization, ensuring that only updated or newly generated log data is transmitted, thereby reducing bandwidth usage and improving transfer speed. This transmission occurs as part of a scheduled routine executed daily after examination sessions conclude, ensuring timely backup and availability of log data for further analysis and archival.

Rsync was selected over SCP for log transmission because it supports delta transfer, checksum verification, and transfer resumption features that ensure both performance and integrity during multiple, incremental log backups. In contrast, SCP lacks these forensic-grade guarantees~\cite{nussbaum2012performance,superuser_rsync_vs_scp,stackexchange_rsync_scp_checksum}.

By using exporters, organizations can automate data workflows, centralize information, and gain valuable insights from their systems. Whether for monitoring, logging, or data migration.

\subsubsection{4.2.4 Log Storage}
In the context of proactive forensic log management, the log storage component plays a critical role in ensuring data availability, integrity, and traceability over time. Logs that have been proactively collected and transmitted must be preserved in a structured and secure manner to support future investigations, audits, and potential legal proceedings.

\begin{figure}[H]

Figure \ref{fig:logs-backup-linux} To ensure efficient log management and prevent data loss, user activity data from the MySQL database related to the English Proficiency Test (EPT) is collected daily and stored in a centralized system. Each log entry is timestamped for accurate tracking, while strategies like log rotation, compression, and regular backups safeguard against data loss. This streamlined approach optimizes storage, enhances accessibility, and ensures the availability of critical data for forensic analysis.

\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:flow-ml-training} illustrates the overall process involved in training a machine learning (ML) model for proactive forensic analysis. The flowchart begins with the acquisition of training data, typically in the form of log files or structured events collected during simulated or real-world scenarios. These datasets undergo preprocessing steps, which may include cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction to ensure they are suitable for model input.

The machine learning model was trained using a dataset comprising 223 labeled instances. To ensure reliable evaluation and prevent class imbalance, the dataset was partitioned using an 80:20 split ratio with stratification. Specifically, 178 instances were allocated for training (\texttt{X\_train}, \texttt{y\_train}), and 45 instances for testing (\texttt{X\_test}, \texttt{y\_test}). The use of \texttt{stratify=y} ensured that the class distribution in both training and testing subsets remained proportional to the original dataset.

In previous research using machine learning to analyze the data log evidence in online exam \citet{garg2023preserving}. Furthermore, to tackle the ongoing challenge of establishing the ground truth in cases of academic dishonesty.

An anomaly detection model was developed using the Isolation Forest algorithm, which is well-suited for identifying outliers in high-dimensional datasets. The model was configured with a contamination rate of \texttt{0.005}, indicating that approximately 0.5\% of the data is assumed to be anomalous. This low contamination value reflects the expectation that only a very small portion of the dataset represents abnormal behavior.

To enhance the robustness of anomaly detection, the model utilizes \texttt{200} estimators (\texttt{n\_estimators}), meaning that 200 isolation trees were built during the training process. The \texttt{max\_samples} parameter was set to \texttt{0.8}, allowing each tree to be trained on 80\% of the available data, which introduces diversity among trees and improves generalization. Additionally, the model uses \texttt{max\_features} set to \texttt{0.75}, meaning that only 75\% of the total features are considered when constructing each tree, further increasing randomness and reducing overfitting.

Finally, the random state was fixed at \texttt{42} to ensure reproducibility across multiple training sessions. This configuration balances sensitivity to rare anomalies with model stability, making it suitable for detecting suspicious behavior in forensic log data.


Use of unsupervised algorithms because the dataset used is unlabeled. The dataset is taken from campuses located in Indonesia with online exams. The dataset used for training machine learning from the exam results on April 1 to 5, 2023. Number of datasets used 223.

\begin{equation}
	\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\end{equation}
Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions that a learner has achieved. It is computed by dividing the number of correct estimates by the total number of prediction \citet{smirani2022algorithm}.
\begin{equation}
	\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
\end{equation}
Precision also known as the positive predictive value, is the ratio of the pertinent instances to the retrieved instances \citet{smirani2022algorithm}.

\begin{equation}
	\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\end{equation}
Recall is also called sensitivity, is a fragment of the retrieved relevant instance \citet{smirani2022algorithm}.
\begin{equation}
	F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\end{equation}
F1-Score is a statistical measure that combines precision and recall with rate performance \citet{smirani2022algorithm}.

\subsubsection{4.2.6 Log Monitoring}
In this research, a custom-developed log management dashboard was implemented to support the forensic readiness framework. Unlike commercial Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions such as Splunk, IBM QRadar, or Elastic Stack (ELK), the custom dashboard was chosen due to its alignment with the goals of flexibility, lightweight deployment, educational accessibility, and forensic specificity.
\textbf{Key reasons for using a custom dashboard include:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cost-efficiency:} SIEM platforms often require commercial licenses or high infrastructure costs, which are not feasible for academic environments or small institutions. A custom solution removes this barrier~\cite{barker2018openlogtools}.
	
	\item \textbf{Forensic Tailoring:} The custom dashboard was purpose-built to handle logs relevant to online examination systems, such as Moodle quiz attempts and user activity, which may not be natively supported or easily modeled in general-purpose SIEMs.
	
	\item \textbf{Transparency and Control:} Full access to the dashboard's source code and data pipelines allows greater transparency in log handling, which is critical for forensic validation and legal defensibility.
	
	\item \textbf{Lightweight and Focused:} SIEM tools often include broad and heavy telemetry modules not needed in this research. The custom dashboard uses a minimal stack (e.g., Flask, SQLite, or REST API) optimized for educational testing environments.
	
	\item \textbf{Ease of Integration with ML Models:} Integrating a machine learning-based anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest) directly into the custom dashboard is more straightforward than embedding it into a complex SIEM architecture.
	
	\item \textbf{Educational and Experimental Use:} In academic research, developing a tailored system allows hands-on experimentation with log structures, forensic workflows, and UI/UX designs—something not always possible with closed or semi-closed SIEMs.
\end{itemize}

Based on these reasons, a custom dashboard provides an ideal platform for validating forensic concepts in a resource-constrained environment while still ensuring critical functionality such as log analysis, visualization, classification, and anomaly alerting.

	\label{fig:log-attempt-step}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:log-attempt-step} illustrates the sequential log attempt steps recorded during an online examination session. Each log entry corresponds to a specific user action captured by the system and is categorized based on its execution state. These states represent the progression and outcome of each exam interaction, allowing forensic analysis to reconstruct user behavior.

The main states observed in the figure include \texttt{todo}, which signifies that the question was displayed to the participant but has not been answered; \texttt{complete}, indicating the participant submitted an answer; and two graded states: \texttt{gradedwrong} and \texttt{gradedright}, which show the automatic evaluation outcome of the submitted response. These log steps are timestamped and ordered, providing a temporal context for each transition.

The data obtained will be stored in a database, including the timestamp and information on when the user committed the cheating. Therefore, the proctor will conduct another check after the exam.

The use of Flask REST API as the backend for log monitoring offers several significant advantages, especially in environments requiring integration with machine learning models for anomaly detection or advanced analytics.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Seamless Integration with Machine Learning Models:} Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, enables straightforward integration of Python-based machine learning models into the backend. This is particularly beneficial since many machine learning libraries (such as \texttt{scikit-learn}, \texttt{TensorFlow}, or \texttt{PyTorch}) are natively supported in Python. As a result, trained models can be loaded, updated, and used for real-time inference directly within Flask endpoints, facilitating automated and scalable log analysis~\cite{garg2023preserving}.
	
	\item \textbf{RESTful API Design for Interoperability:} Flask REST API allows the development of standardized endpoints for receiving, processing, and returning log data and analysis results. This RESTful design ensures that the backend can communicate easily with various frontend dashboards, notification systems, and external services, enhancing system modularity and interoperability.
	
	\item \textbf{Flexibility and Rapid Development:} Flask’s simplicity makes it easy to develop, customize, and extend the backend for new features or integration with other Python scripts. This is essential in research or academic environments, where experimentation and frequent modifications are common.
	
	\item \textbf{Scalability and Deployment:} Flask applications can be containerized (e.g., using Docker) and scaled horizontally, supporting increased data volume or more complex analytical workloads.
	
	\item \textbf{Open Source and Community Support:} As an open-source project, Flask benefits from a large community and many available extensions, including those for authentication, security, and database connectivity, making it suitable for secure and reliable log management backends.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{4.2.7 Notification}
In the development of the forensic log management framework, Telegram was selected as the primary alerting mechanism for several practical and technical reasons. While various alternatives exist for real-time notification systems such as email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or SIEM integrated alerting the use of the Telegram Bot API offers a unique combination of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility suitable for research and institutional deployments~\cite{wang2023telegramalert}.

\begin{figure}[H] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=14cm]{figure/log-notification.jpeg}
	\caption{Notification}
	\label{fig:telegram-notification}
\end{figure}

Fig \ref{fig:telegram-notification} notification feature through Telegram bots is to facilitate better monitoring and response in an online examination system. Notification of the proactive analysis log results will be sent via telegram. 

However, the current implementation still requires manual intervention to trigger the notification to administrators or proctors. That is, although the log analysis system flags a suspicious case, an operator must manually confirm and forward the alert. This limitation reduces the level of automation in the incident response process. Future development should consider implementing a fully automated alerting mechanism, where notifications are sent immediately upon detection of a suspicious event.
\subsubsection{4.2.8 Log Preservation}
\begin{figure}[H] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=18cm]{figure/log_preservation.png}
	\caption{Log Preservation Directory}
	\label{fig:log-preservation-1}
\end{figure}

In the figure \ref{fig:log-preservation-1}, it is a list that shows the date and timestamp information of activities performed by proactive log collection in the previous phase. Then, within it, there are three things obtained.

\begin{figure}[H] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=18cm]{figure/log_preservation_detail.png}
	\caption{Detail Log Preservation}
	\label{fig:log-preservation-2}
\end{figure}

The display in the figure \ref{fig:log-preservation-2} shows the contents of log preservation. There are three logs that can be viewed: log attempt, log attempt step, and log general. Each log also has its hash value calculated to prevent log data changes or log tampering.

In preserving forensic log evidence, integrity verification is critical to ensure that log files remain unchanged from collection to analysis. Two widely used hash functions are MD5 and SHA‑256:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{MD5}: Despite known vulnerabilities, MD5 remains a common checksum tool in digital forensics due to its speed and broad tool support. Empirical research confirms that MD5 collisions, while technically feasible, pose minimal practical risk in forensic contexts when combined with procedural controls~\cite{easttom2021cryptographic, kessler2016impact}.
	\item \textbf{SHA‑256}: As part of the SHA‑2 family, SHA‑256 offers strong collision resistance and is widely regarded as secure for forensic evidence authentication. It resists both pre‑image and collision attacks, ensuring any alteration in log data is reliably detected~\cite{pagefreezer_sha256, numberanalytics_sha256}.
\end{itemize}

Adopting a dual-hash approach offers several benefits:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Performance flexibility}: MD5 provides rapid integrity checks for large volumes of log data, useful for routine verification.
	\item \textbf{Forensic robustness}: SHA‑256 gives higher assurance for legal and forensic purposes, satisfying standards such as ISO 27037 and NIST guidelines.
	\item \textbf{Risk mitigation}: In the rare case of an MD5 hash collision, the SHA‑256 comparison acts as a secondary safeguard.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

The log reporting document serves as a consolidated summary of user activity during online examinations. It includes essential information such as the participant's name, timestamp of each recorded action, and a classification status indicating whether the behavior is considered suspicious. This structured report enables proctors or administrators to review potential anomalies efficiently and supports the decision-making process for further investigation or enforcement actions. The inclusion of timestamped events and flagged indicators enhances the traceability and forensic value of the evidence collected.
\subsection{4.3 Document and Improvment}
The documentation and improvement sub-phase is an essential part of the framework development cycle, ensuring that all challenges, limitations, and enhancements are systematically recorded and addressed. Throughout the simulation and implementation stages, detailed logs were maintained to capture issues such as configuration errors, integration problems, unexpected system behavior, and performance bottlenecks.

All observed problems were documented in a structured format, including timestamps, descriptions, affected modules, and immediate mitigation steps taken. For example, early in the testing phase, mismatches in log extraction scheduling were identified, resulting in incomplete data collection. This issue was resolved by adjusting cron job intervals and synchronizing log transmission routines. Similarly, occasional false positives in the anomaly detection module prompted refinement of detection thresholds and feature selection strategies.

The iterative documentation process not only enabled effective troubleshooting but also supported continuous improvement of the framework. Regular team reviews and expert feedback were incorporated, resulting in several key enhancements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Optimization of log parsing scripts to handle edge cases and diverse data formats.
	\item Implementation of more granular access controls for log storage and preservation.
	\item Refinement of notification logic to avoid redundant or delayed alerts.
	\item Adjustment of machine learning model parameters for improved detection accuracy.
\end{itemize}

This ongoing process of documentation and improvement ensures that the framework evolves to meet both functional and forensic requirements, while also establishing a comprehensive record for future audits and knowledge transfer. The result is a more robust, reliable, and operationally effective forensic log management system, ready for pilot deployment and further validation.

Phase 4 involves the implementation and simulation of the designed forensic log management framework within a controlled test environment. This phase validates whether the architectural design and functional components can operate effectively in practice, especially in the context of online examination scenarios.

The simulation was conducted using a testbed environment that replicates the infrastructure of an actual university's online exam system.




\section{Phase 5}
Phase 5 focuses on evaluating the implemented forensic log management framework through simulated forensic scenarios. This evaluation aims to determine whether the system is capable of supporting proactive forensic readiness—particularly in the context of online examination environments where incidents such as impersonation, unauthorized access, or rapid submission attempts may occur.
\subsection{Verification}
The results obtained from the experiment using the log management method revealed the phases from identification to reporting logs in online exams. The results can be seen in the table below.

\begin{table}[H]

	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:verifying_log_framework}
\end{table}


Table \ref{tab:verifying_log_framework} can be used to verify that the framework adopted from NIST 800-92 works as expected. The verification results of the framework show that each phase has been carried out according to its objectives and has achieved results that align with what was intended.



\section{Phase 6}
Phase 6 is the final stage in the development lifecycle, focusing on the validation of the proposed forensic log management framework by relevant domain experts. The purpose of this phase is to assess the framework’s technical soundness, practical applicability, and completeness when applied in real-world online examination environments.


\subsection{Validation}
To assess the effectiveness and practicality of the developed proactive forensic log management system, a validation process was conducted involving a panel of domain experts. The purpose of this validation was to evaluate the system's alignment with digital forensic principles, its technical reliability, and its suitability for use in online examination environments.

\textbf{Justification for Using Interviews:}  
The interview method was chosen because it enables deeper exploration of expert perspectives that may not be captured through quantitative surveys. Given the complexity and domain-specific nature of the system particularly in relation to log integrity, forensic readiness, and anomaly detection semi-structured interviews allow experts to elaborate on technical insights and provide contextual evaluations. This method is also appropriate for validating design decisions in early-stage frameworks where practical deployment feedback is critical.

\textbf{Main Questions Asked:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is the scope of log data collected sufficient for forensic investigation?
	\item Does the system maintain the integrity and traceability of log data effectively?
	\item How reliable is the anomaly detection approach based on machine learning?
	\item Are the notification and reporting features helpful for exam monitoring?
	\item Could this system be realistically deployed in a real online examination environment?
\end{itemize}

	\caption{Comparison of Proactive and Reactive Forensic Based on Log Management Aspects}
	\label{tab:forensic-log-comparison}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{5.5cm}|p{5.5cm}|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Proactive Forensic} & \textbf{Reactive Forensic} \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Log Generation} & Logging is configured in advance with consistent policies to capture all relevant events, even before incidents occur. & Logging may not be fully enabled until after an incident is detected or suspected. \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Log Transmission} & Logs are periodically transmitted to a centralized repository as part of ongoing readiness. & Logs may be manually collected from devices post-incident; transmission is reactive and possibly delayed. \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Log Storage} & Logs are stored securely with defined retention periods, using structured directories and integrity-preserving mechanisms. & Logs may be scattered or incomplete; storage begins or is prioritized after an incident is identified. \\
		\hline
		\textbf{Log Analysis} & Analysis is conducted before incidents occur, aiming to identify anomalies and potential threats early (proactive log analysis). & Analysis is difficult if logs are incomplete or missing; lack of evidence may hinder investigation. \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Table \ref{tab:forensic-log-comparison} compares proactive and reactive forensic approaches based on key aspects of log management. In proactive forensics, log generation is pre-configured with consistent policies to ensure comprehensive event capture before incidents occur, whereas reactive forensics often lack complete logging until an incident is suspected. Proactive approaches also include scheduled log transmission to a centralized repository, secure storage with structured organization and integrity measures, and early-stage log analysis to detect anomalies. In contrast, reactive methods typically rely on delayed or manual log collection, ad-hoc storage, and limited analysis capabilities due to incomplete or missing logs, which can hinder effective investigations.

\end{table}


Table \ref{tab:log-management-challanges-output-method}, Log management initiates with Log Identification for comprehensive source mapping, frequently encountering interoperability issues with legacy system formats. Subsequent Log Proactive Collection utilizes automated daily backup mechanisms, presenting potential database server performance impacts. Analysis is conducted through a Custom Dashboard (Log Analyzer).



The log management phase is structured in the following sequence to support proactive forensic readiness:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Database Log Sources} \\
	The process begins with capturing high-relevance log data from the database, such as quiz attempts and user session activity, which serve as primary sources for digital forensic analysis.
	
	\item \textbf{Periodic Proactive Log Collection} \\
	Log data is periodically extracted from the database and other sources through automated mechanisms to ensure consistent and up-to-date monitoring of user activities.
	
	\item \textbf{Log Storage} \\
	Collected logs are then stored in a centralized, structured, and secure directory system, with mechanisms for timestamping, access control, and integrity verification.
\end{enumerate}
