	Anomaly Detection & A machine learning technique used to identify unusual patterns or outliers in data, which may indicate cheating or abnormal activity during online exams.\\
	Dashboard & A web-based interface for visualizing, monitoring, and analyzing log data and system activities.\\
	Digital Forensics & The process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence to investigate incidents or breaches.\\
	Evidence Integrity & Assurance that collected digital evidence (log data) remains complete, authentic, and unaltered from its original state.\\
	Forensic Readiness & The ability of an organization to maximize its potential to use digital evidence while minimizing the costs of an investigation.\\
	Isolation Forest & An unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to detect anomalies in datasets; applied for identifying suspicious online exam behavior.\\
	LMS (Learning Management System) & A software platform for delivering, managing, and tracking online courses and assessments.\\
	Log Analysis & The examination and interpretation of log data to detect patterns, incidents, or irregularities.\\
	Log Collection & The process of gathering log data from various sources such as servers, databases, applications, and operating systems.\\
	Log Management & A systematic approach to generating, collecting, transmitting, storing, analyzing, preserving, and reporting logs, often following frameworks such as NIST SP 800-92.\\
	Log Preservation & Ensuring the secure storage and protection of log data so that it can be used as reliable digital evidence.\\
	MD5 Hash & A cryptographic hash function producing a 32-character checksum used to verify the integrity of files or log data.\\
	Moodle & An open-source Learning Management System (LMS) used for managing online learning and exams.\\
	Proactive Forensics & A forensic approach that involves collecting and analyzing evidence before an incident occurs, with the aim of early detection and prevention.\\
	Rsync & A utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between servers, used in the log transmission process.\\
	Scheduler (Cron) & A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like systems that automates tasks such as log backup and extraction.\\
	Telegram Bot & An automated tool for sending real-time notifications or alerts through the Telegram messaging application.\\
	Timestamp & A sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, typically used in log entries.\\
